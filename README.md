# Embed
This code appears to be an implementation of the Ownable trait for a StarkNet contract. Let's break down the main components:

#[starknet::embeddable]: This is likely an attribute provided by the StarkNet framework, indicating that the following code is meant to be embedded into a StarkNet contract.

impl Ownable<...> of super::IOwnable<TContractState>: This is an implementation of the Ownable trait for a type TContractState. The Ownable trait likely defines functionality related to ownership, and this implementation adheres to the requirements specified for the trait.

fn owner(self: @TContractState) -> ContractAddress: This function is meant to retrieve the owner of the contract. It takes self as a parameter, which is a reference to the contract state (@TContractState). It returns a ContractAddress, indicating the owner's address.

fn transfer_ownership(ref self: TContractState, new_owner: ContractAddress): This function is used to transfer ownership of the contract. It takes a reference to the contract state (TContractState) and a new owner's address (ContractAddress) as parameters.

fn renounce_ownership(ref self: TContractState): This function is meant for the owner to renounce ownership. It takes a reference to the contract state (TContractState) as a parameter.

It seems like this code is part of a larger contract system, and it leverages the Ownable trait to provide ownership-related functionality to contracts. The actual implementation of the trait functions is likely in the OwnableImpl type, which is not provided in the code snippet.
